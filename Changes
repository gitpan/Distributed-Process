        The D::P::Client sends a /worker command when it first connects. This
        allows for initialization tasks to take place on the server side.
        Notably, the D::P::Master now only considers itself 'ready to run' when
        all the clients have sent their /worker command, not only when they
        have connected.
        D::P::RemoteWorker now has the id() attribute from its Client
        couterpart (sent through the /worker command), and exposes an
        is_ready() method, which the D::P::Master queries to know whether it is
        'ready to run'.
        D::P::Master::workers() now returns the workers ordered by id().
        t/10-postpone.t should no longer block like it used to do sometimes.
        Other tests have been improved, notably t/11-time.t and t/09-session.t
        which sometimes failed for no obvious reason (was due to the
        unpredictable order of the D::P::Master::workers list).
        New INFO, WARN and ERROR message output function to complete the
        existing DEBUG.
        D::P::Master::run() now gets the results from D::P::Master::result()
        instead of getting them directly from its D::P::MasterWorker (this
        allows for overloading the way results are filtered).

        Passing a coderef as argument to a __method now works also when calling
        it under time().
        The __methods are now redefined in the worker_class and also in its
        ancestor classes if any.

        Added /reset command to flush the results between two run().
        Passing a coderef as argument to a __method called within run() will
        have it executed for each P::D::RemoteWorker, not only once by the
        P::D::MasterWorker.
        worker_args() are now passed on to the P::D::MasterWorker also.
