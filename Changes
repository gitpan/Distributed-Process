Revision history for Distributed-Process

        Added /reset command to flush the results between two run().
        Passing a coderef as argument to a __method called within run() will
        have it executed for each P::D::RemoteWorker, not only once by the
        P::D::MasterWorker.
        worker_args() are now passed on to the P::D::MasterWorker also.
