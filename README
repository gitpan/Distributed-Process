Distributed-Process

This module provides a framework for running a process simultaneously on
several machines.

It was first designed to conduct stress tests session, where several computers
would send queries to a server at the same time, but it might prove useful for
other purposes.

This distribution provides code to run server to conduct the "workers", and to
run the client that do the actual work.

The task to distribute must be implemented in a subclass of
Distributed::Process::Worker, by overloading its run() method. Any call to a
method whose name starts with a double underscore (__method) will be sent to
the clients, which will run it, and send the results back to the server for
analysis.

Please read the documentation for Distributed::Process for further details, and
remember that this is still alpha code.
